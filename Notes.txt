In Java, we can mark a method or block as synchronized, which means that only one thread will be able to enter that method or block at a given point of time.

Inter-Thread Communication

Inter-thread communication allows synchronized threads to communicate with each other using a set of methods.

The methods used are wait, notify, and notifyAll, which are all inherited from the Object class.

Wait() causes the current thread to wait indefinitely until some other thread calls notify() or notifyAll() on the same object. 

Semaphore: Software based solution to synchronization problem. Manage concurrent processes using one non negative integer value
which is shared between the threads.
semaphore variable can be accessed only with wait() and signal() operation
